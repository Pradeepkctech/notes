Large funds which like education but also do many other things:

- [Hewlett Foundation OER](http://www.hewlett.org/programs/education/open-educational-resources). No individuals, unlikely to grant spontaneous requests, priority to charity.
- edCrunch [philanthropy](http://edcrunch.org/show-me-the-money/foundations-and-philanthropy/) and [investors](http://edcrunch.org/show-me-the-money/accelerators-and-investors).
- [MacArthur foundation](http://www.macfound.org/programs/fellows/strategy/). Any domain, but someone must nominate you, and you must already be already a genius on your domain. US residents / citizens only.
- [Michael & Susan Dell Foundation](http://www.msdf.org/). Education is one of it's focuses. No individuals.
- [Bauer media 100M in Europe](http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/04/bauer-venture-partners). Not exclusive for publishing, but that will probably be one of their focuses so they can buy back new tech.
