# Tor

Sites that block tor users:

-   Twitter: "Your account has been locked.", use cell phone. <https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3o4klb/twitter_blocking_tor_signups/> <https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/twitter-users-keep-getting-locked-out-of-their-accounts-for-using-tor>
-   Facebook: account locked, need cell phone.
-   Stack Overflow: login confirm button does not work. But if you answer a question, and require account creation, it works.
-   Reddit: shadowbans new users by default on a subreddit basis:
    - https://www.reddit.com/r/onions/comments/1ogwty/reddit_instantly_shadowbans_new_accounts_created/
    - https://www.reddit.com/r/TOR/comments/4gurz8/reddit_shadowbanning_accounts/
-   GitHub: flags your account, and erases all your content for a while.
