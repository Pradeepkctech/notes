# Quora

From the perspective of a Stack Overflow contributor.

Downsides:

- "What is the meaning of life?" style questions render reputation useless
- Most questions are one sentence long, but there there is a semi-hidden "Add question details dialogue". The canonised name determines the URL, so you cannot change it later.
- Cannot see other people's credits? Follows and views are possible metrics but less useful. http://www.quora.com/Can-I-view-how-many-credits-someone-else-has
- Hard to see question upvote count
- Cannot upvote questions: http://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-way-to-vote-questions-up-and-down-on-Quora-If-not-why-not
- Questions don't show data anywhere by design! https://www.quora.com/Why-doesnt-Quora-show-when-a-question-was-added
