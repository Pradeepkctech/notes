# Why not have a public tracker

I wonder why they do it.

Most likely:

1. hide issue information from concurrency (what features do people want on GitHub?)
2. hide information in case of intellectual property wars. E.g. if someone creates a feature request, GitHub implements first, GitLab second, then if the issue is public it is easier for GitLab to argue that the idea was previous public knowledge.
3. Prevent security issues. Someone may unknowingly report a bug which later proves to be a security problem.
4. Hide their errors to look smart. If there is no list of bugs or feature requests, they look smarter.
5. Prevent users from leaking their own private data.
