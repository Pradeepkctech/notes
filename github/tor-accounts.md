# Tor accounts

GitHub flags all tor accounts, which hides you from the public, then you can contact them, and they often clean you up manually.

Here is a list of what they cleaned up or not for me:

- completely clean tor account unrelated to anything: yes. But a few days later, re-flagged!!!
- myusername-somesuffix + say I'm not @myusername user on profile: yes
- linustorvalds-notkernel + say I'm not @torvalds user on profile: todo https://archive.fo/Vza9C
