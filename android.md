#### Unicode input

<http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/17994/how-can-i-type-special-symbols-on-my-android-device-like-or-as-a-regular-cha>

This currently looks like the only Unicode keyboard out there, but it is paid! <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.cwd.unicodekeyboard>

#### Google Keyboard

Voice recognition button is there, but does nothing! Android 5.1.1, latest Google keyboard: <https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/nexus/SGacqxsz09I> The top answer there worked!

### Google search bar does not fit anymore on the top of the home screen

Settings -> Apps -> All -> Xperia Home -> Clear data -> OK.

### WhatsApp

Web interface: https://web.whatsapp.com/ App menu does not have the button for me: <http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/96531/how-to-scan-qr-code-for-whatsapp-web#comment162747_96547>

### Facebook messenger

Why it exists in addition to WhatsApp: <http://thenextweb.com/facebook/2014/04/10/facebooks-two-pronged-mobile-messaging-app-strategy/>

Meh, they just bought off the competition.

#### Facebook chat heads

### Contacts

TODO? Call with custom app: E.g. Skype. Only works for WhatsApp out of the box...

#### Per contact ringtone

Yes, from the magic Contacts app!

Select a contact, hit the menu item then set ringtone.

### Wallpaper

### Ringtone

Remove gap: <http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/24466/how-do-i-remove-delay-between-ringtones>

Psychoacoustics: best type:

- <http://www.everydaylistening.com/articles/2011/5/29/the-definition-of-a-good-ringtone.html>
- <http://gizmodo.com/5983194/whats-the-best-ringtone-youve-ever-heard>

My take:

- high pitch is more audible
- more continuous sound is better
- not longer than 4 seconds so you know it is a ringtone, how many times it sounded, and not regular music
- does not start too abruptly so as to not jump scare you

Good song starts:

- qu yuan lisao
- return to forever medieval ouverture

#### Ringtone location

- http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/56905/where-is-the-default-ringtone-stored
- http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/123802/location-for-custom-ringtones-alarms-notifications-that-hides-them-from-play-mus
- http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/28300/how-to-manually-upload-ringtones-and-notifications-to-droidx

Best place seems:

    /system/media/audio/ringtones

`ogg` and `mp3` both worked fine.

#### Media scan

Songs don't show by default after you copy them manually there: <http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/56905/where-is-the-default-ringtone-stored/56908?noredirect=1#comment162980_56908>

You need to trigger the media scan.

One way to do that is to reboot.

From the CLI without rebooting: <http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/51784/can-i-trigger-a-media-scan-via-the-the-command-line>

There's an app for that: <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.addz.mediascanner>

### Native development

Dev android apps inside Android!

<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aide.ui&feature=search_result>

### Sky

## Bloatware

Shitty software pre-installed by OEMs or carriers to get money from your personal information.

E.g., my Vivo (Brazilian carrier) + Sony Xperia Z3 has bloatware from both Vivo and Sony.

Apple forbids carriers from doing it it seems.

<http://www.greenbot.com/article/2920125/dear-carriers-please-stop-putting-bloatware-on-my-android-phone.html>

And on top of that, most bloatware cannot be uninstalled without rooting!!

### Skins

GUI changes made by OEMs or carriers to steal your data.

- Samsung: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TouchWiz>
- LG G UI
- HTC Sense UI
- Sony Xperia UI

### Stock device

No bloatware.

Near stock devices: <http://www.phonearena.com/news/Best-2015-smartphones-that-run-stock-or-near-stock-Android_id75780>

#### Google play edition

Certified near stock devices.

<http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/01/dont-cry-for-the-google-play-edition-program-it-was-already-dead/>

Died.

#### Google Nexus

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Nexus>

No bloatware phones.

Strategy:

### QR code scan

No built-in apparently:

## Internals

- Found on About phone: <https://www.quora.com/What-does-kernel-version-mean-and-why-is-the-Android-version-and-the-kernel-version-different>
- big list: <http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/51651/which-android-runs-which-linux-kernel> but it was wrong according to my about phone

Usage data: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_version_history#/media/File:Android_historical_version_distribution_-_vector.svg>

## App isolation

Each App runs under a different UID: <http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/67188/android-app-isolation-risks-implementation> So it just reuses Linux's security.

## HTML GUI

<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9045355/how-to-create-an-android-app-using-html-5>
<http://developer.android.com/guide/webapps/index.html>

Android uses it's custom GUI API. Some day, maybe.

### adb

### am

Developer helper command line utilities.

- <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6613889/how-to-start-an-android-application-from-the-command-line>

### AOSP

Open source parts of Android: missing driver blobs and Google proprietary apps.

Google develops it's features in secret, and then releases the source afterwards.

#### Utility replacements

- `ifconfig`: `netcfg` + `ifconfig`
- `env`: `printenv`

### libc

Bionic, Google-made.

### SSH connect

<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11468053/how-can-i-communicate-with-an-android-device-via-ssh>

Remember that Nautilus can use it: <http://askubuntu.com/questions/456669/nautilus-connect-to-server-via-ssh-no-longer-present-in-ubuntu-14-04>

### Find local device IP

- <http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/2984/how-can-i-see-what-ip-address-my-android-phone-has>
- <http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/3715/is-there-a-command-or-application-similar-to-ipconfig>

Best method:

    netcfg

from a terminal emulator app.

### Root

### sudo

TODO what does it do exactly?

- <http://gizmodo.com/5982287/reasons-to-root-your-android-device>
- <http://www.androidcentral.com/root>
- <http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/how-to-root-android/>

Many rooted apps are available on the Play store itself. Google is much less restrictive than Apple is about jailbreaking.

You need to backup your ROM and replace it with a new one.

Kingo Root method: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWNykj-lb-I>

Once you have it, just type `su` on the SSH session or terminal emulator and go.

### ROM

Read only memory.

Stores the OS.

Mounted under `/system`

If you root the device, you can change it, and make a custom Android however you like.

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIi4KXgZYsI&feature=iv&src_vid=AWNykj-lb-I&annotation_id=annotation_162326159>

#### Cyanogenmod

<http://www.cyanogenmod.org/> near stock experience.

### Desktop

Kill Windows.

- <http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/4021/how-can-i-execute-command-in-the-terminal-as-root>

Undocumented? Great.

### File hierarchy

- <http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/46926/android-folder-hierarchy>
- <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8268186/android-what-is-the-default-location-for-storing-images>
- <http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/27692/where-is-current-wallpaper-stored-on-jellybean>

#### Internal storage

<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25361238/difference-between-internal-sd-card-and-internal-storage>

The internal SD card is partitioned and mounted as follows:

- `/system` is mounted readonly and is the ROM
- `/sdcard` internal SD card
    - `/sdcard/Music` main music location. Apps will look there by default, but on other places as well. TODO API enforced, or just convention?
    - `/sdcard/Pictures` stock pictures
    - `/sdcard/Pictures/Screenshots`
    - `/sdcard/Ringtones`
    - Play Music location: <http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/16220/where-does-google-music-store-offline-songs>
- `/data` is called "Internal storage", and contains apps and their data
- `/storage`

### USB debugging mode

TODO? What is that?

Enabled from Developer options

Disable the eternal notification: <http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/5075/how-do-i-disable-the-usb-connected-notification>

### Tether

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tethering>

Requires root, but available on Google Store.

Carriers may require you to pay for that if you tether from their network instead of LAN, which is why Android disables it by default.

Root allows you to re-enable that.

## Google play

Software distribution.

There is manual guideline reviewing. No test apps accepted. No porn, violence, etc. Bullshit.

Content policy: <https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy.html>

### Distribute App without Google Play

- <http://developer.android.com/distribute/tools/open-distribution.html>
- <http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/90523/how-can-i-publish-an-android-game-without-google-play>

Don't forget to enable non-Google Play sources under:

    Sources > Security > Unknown sources

### Google store

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Store

Sells hardware.

### Publishing on Google Play

You have to pay a `25$` signup fee!

<https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-publish-an-Android-app-free-in-the-Google-Play-store>

You need an alternative Android market. Huge list: <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6939652/where-can-i-upload-my-android-apps-for-free>

- <http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/123905/what-is-the-difference-between-temp-root-pemanent-root-what-is-a-soft-reboot>

Apparently soft rest is more superficial, and thus faster, but solves less problems.
