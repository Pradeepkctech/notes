## Computer won't turn on when you press the power button

There may be some inner power state that is wrong.

Steps:

- take out power cord
- take out battery
- hold power for 30 seconds or more
- put back power cord, not battery
- try turning on again

## RAM

### DRAM

In 2015, what we use for memory: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_random-access_memory

### SRAM

In 2015, what we use for caches: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_random-access_memory

Faster and more expensive than DRAM: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_random-access_memory

### ECC memory

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECC_memory>

Error-correcting code memory.

For applications where errors cannot be tolerated like scientific and financial computing.

Wiki article also talks about DRAM taken to space to observe bit flip ratio, which basically proves that they are caused mostly by cosmic ray neutron secondaries.

4:3 was the original TV.

16:9 was first introduced for films, and then adopted by laptops in 2008. Also plays well with the keyboard, which is itself rectangular and not square.

Ways to connect hardware to the motherboard.

First came ISA, then PCI, and then PCIe.
