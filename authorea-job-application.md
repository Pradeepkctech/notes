Hi,

I've just seen the funding news on TechCrunch, and then the full stack position on the About page, and I'd like to apply.

Why I think I may add value to the team:

# I am devoted to improving textbook creation and thus self driven

I have been working on a similar product for the last year: https://github.com/booktree/booktree, GitHub for book development via GitLab.

In doing so, I have:

-   merged several full stack features (some major) to GitLab make it better for book editing + many bug fixes and refactorings.

    Full contribution list: http://www.cirosantilli.com/contrib/#merged-by-others (sort by project and by size to see only the GitLab ones).

    I have decided to merge back as much text editing related features as possible before forking them so this is why I haven't forked them yet. This allowed me to work as a team with them so I could learn from more experienced developers.

    As an example, the next big feature I plan is merge conflict resolution: https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/pull/7345, which I specified myself.

    My contributions have made be the 2nd largest contributor by number of lines in the last 2 years (after the lead dev randx...): https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/graphs/contributors?from=2012-11-03&to=2014-09-22&type=a

    I believe you may be a GitLab fork from mid 2013.

-   researched extensively the market and thought about what has to be done.

    E.g., I have compiled a features table at: http://booktree.github.io/alternatives/ ,
    and proposed several features on the GitLab feedback forum: http://feedback.gitlab.com/users/42957132-ciro-santilli
    (I have 5 accounts there because it limits 10 issues per account.....)

The reason why I have been working on this project without getting paid for the last year: **BECAUSE THIS IS THE MOST USEFUL THING THAT I CAN DO FOR THE WORLD**. Education and research could be so much better than they are now. Education and research are useful and beautiful.

I wish we can work together towards this common goal instead of competing.

# I graduated from good schools in Brazil and France

I participated in a double degree program in applied mathematics between:

- University of Sao Paulo (Brazil)
- École Polytechnique (Lozère, France)

which are amongst the most famous in engineering known in their respective countries. Links to some school metrics at: http://www.cirosantilli.com/education/

I have spent 3 years in each, and earned both degrees, including the Masters 2 level in France.

My courses were a mixture of applied mathematics and computer science, and in parallel I have given great attention to sharpening my more practical programming skills.
