After close call between Samsung Galaxy A50 and Pixel 3a, went with Pixel 3a for camera, software updates, vanillaness.

=== Motorola Moto 6G Play

Bought from amazon: https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07CGJTL8J for on 2018-07 for 159.99 pounds "motorola moto g6 Play 5.7-Inch Android 8.0 Oreo SIM-Free Smartphone with 3GB RAM and 32GB Storage (Dual Sim) - Deep Indigo (Exclusive to Amazon)"

Variants with known codenames: https://www.phonemore.com/models/motorola/moto-g6-play/

The only Europe/UK ones are: XT1922-2 32GB and 64GB.

Display: 5.7 inches

2018-11: screen broken when a bowl fell on it from just one foot height...

Cannot get compass working on Google Maps... seems to work only when on a car moving fast.

Camera is noticeably worse than the Z3, limited depth of field, and my photos are just generally blurry. I'm never getting such a cheap phone again.

2019-12: something possibly a piece of soft wood got stuck in charger port. I'm an idiot and first stuck the power cable back in, which made it really compact, and then tried to removed it with metallic tools like scissors without turning phone off, I think I saw a spark at some point. The hole was clean, but it stopped charging altogether. Battery still supplying power so presumably only charging port affected.

Managed to open with a cheap heat gun and suction cup I bought this time. Will try to replace charging port, bought https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/202414028090 (http://web.archive.org/web/20200107214924/http://web.archive.org/screenshot/https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/401757808387[archive]).

Replacing charging port worked! Now need to buy fucking glue to close it, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6huXiIgHR0&t=622s uses Zhanlida T-7000, even the glue is Chinese and has to be imported! Buying: https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/123964209305 50ml 5 pounds.

This was a great brand. But it died apparently: https://www.phonearena.com/news/Why-are-Sony-smartphones-not-popular-anymore_id113661

Carrier: Vivo.

Camera:

Brazil only model it seems, http://forum.xda-developers.com/z3/help/how-to-proceed-d6643-model-t2960099, but very similar to the more international D6653.

GPU: Adreno 330

2018: I think the SD card got pulled out, then:

* it takes a while for display to show up after phone sleeps (power button, and wait a few minutes. Immediate wakeup works, it must enter some sleep mode afterwards)
* there are random flickers / static after it comes back, or when some actions come up:

I removed SD card, and did factory reset, but nothing.

Safe mode: hold power button, then hold power off on screen, then it asks you. Disables all third party apps (non-pre installed).

Tried opening it, it was hard, all glued crap. Managed, but could see nothing wrong with display cable.

Linux kernel logs don't show, but do show with the exact same components on the Pi 3 (SD card with `enable_uart=1` + image Raspbian Lite 2018-11-03 and UART cables).

Linux on SSH and bare metal blinker both work on this board, so the rest of the board seems alive.

Brand on extractor glass: Elica: https://elica.com

Dimensions: 45.9cm x 17.6cm on the exterior. Too long to fit into any container that we have.

Brand on filter itself: "ARMA Filtre a.s." based on markings: http://www.armafiltre.com.tr/uygulamalar/7/3/en/Home-Appliances.html Cannot find any model on website however... looks like Elica's B2B supplier only.

Marker inside after removing filter: 12NC: 208298104403 Model: CIAK GR/A/56.

Aluminium extractor filter for 208298104403

Hi there,

I'm trying to buy a spare aluminium extractor filter for an Elica extractor, but I can't find the right size on the website.

My 12NC is : 208298104403

My filter looks a lot like this: https://shop.elica.com/en/accessori/filtro-grassi-in-alluminio-cod-GRI0077330A.html but the dimensions are different: I measured 45.9cm x 17.6cm on my old one.

Do you have that for sale?

==== House 2018 light bulbs

2019-11: front right kitchen lamp burnt, Sylvania GU10 50W. 50W was likely some useless "incandescent equivalent" measure. Replaced: GE LED 5W 345 lumens 2700K Warm 15k hours, which looks exactly the same.

2019-05: left one burnt. Was: DURA G4 12V20W: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Halogen-Light-Bulbs-Lamps-5watt/dp/B003IVP12A Replaced: Sainsbury's halogen G4 20W12V.

==== Toilet mirror lamps

When I came, two Bell GU4 (MR11) 20W 12v.

One burnt. Put in an ASDA halogen one.

ASDA burnt, put in TopLux on right, old Bell left.

2019-01-24, right one burnt a few days ago, old Bell still works. Inner part black, and black dot on the wire. Putting new TopLux again, but this time on the left, old bell on right.

2019-01-24 toilet top lamp also burnt a few days ago, but not at the same time as mirror. Diall, 240V 40W, GU10. Putting in IKEA 240V 35W.

2019-02-02 toilet mirror lamp left (TopLux) burnt. Don't know what to do anymore. Only the magic Bell lamp works.

2019-03-06 toilet top lamp left burnt, IKEA 240V 35W GU10. Putting in another one.

2019-03-28 toilet top lamp right burnt, IKEA 240V 35W GU10. Waiting for people to come to look at transformer, there is definitely something wrong.

2019-04-03 top lamps: replaced with LED (LAP GU10 3W) since lower power, transformer not changed. Mirror lamps: transformer changed, left one replaced with Homebase Halogen 20W 12V. When I came back lamps flickering badly and sometimes not turning on, recalled technician.

2019-04-12 mirror lamp: it was just he connector that was bad, it was changed, also put LEDs there to make it less warm and hopefully have less tear on connector.

=== Bicycle tire sizes

There are two main parts to the tire: the "tire" (casing + thread) and the "inner tube"

What a mess, just ISO all the way I say.

Go over these three like mad until it makes sense:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_5775
* https://www.sheldonbrown.com/tire-sizing.html (https://web.archive.org/web/20190925051837/https://www.sheldonbrown.com/tire-sizing.html[archive])
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_tire
* https://www.cyclinguk.org/cyclists-library/components/wheels-tyres/tyre-sizes

For diameter, almost all adult bikes as of 2019 are 700mm (622 ISO)

French system (e.g. 700 x ) measures up to outer tire, ISO measures rim only.
