Downsides:

- "What is the meaning of life?" style questions render reputation useless
- Questions are one sentence long, cannot expand more. The canonised name determines the URL, so you cannot change it later.
- Cannot see other people's credits? Follows and views are possible metrics but less useful. http://www.quora.com/Can-I-view-how-many-credits-someone-else-has
- Hard to see question upvote count
- Cannot upvote questions: http://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-way-to-vote-questions-up-and-down-on-Quora-If-not-why-not
