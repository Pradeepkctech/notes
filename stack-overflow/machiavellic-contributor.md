-   when you find a duplicate pool answer every question with similar answers. Quote the answer to make it clear that you really answered it.

    If they can me marked as duplicates, do so, or you risk getting your answers deleted.

    Furthermore, closed questions continue netting rep to upvotes, and prevent new answers from coming in.

-   look at the linked and related questions for duplicates and subsets (A also solves B), and cross site duplicates on Google.

    It can happen that a better answer exists outside of the best question (oldest most upvotes).

    From every non-best question, link to the best you've answered.

-   follow on Twitter / RSS someone who comments on the top features of new software releases. E.g. for Git, follow GitHub on Twitter. Then run back to any question which has a new answer.

-   always upvote the question when you answer it:

    - the more upvotes, more likely people are to click it.
    - the OP is more likely to see your answer and feel good and upvote you

-   if a question only has few answers and you come with a good one, upvote the existing ones.

    This may lead to existing answers upvoting you.

    Even if they don't, other people will still see your answer anyways, and this will lead to people to upvoting you more just to make your great answer surpass the current ones. Being second is often an asset.

-   always upvote comments that favor you:

    - I like this answer!
    - also look at that question (when you have answered it)

-   give answers with a mixture of:

    - simple concrete examples
    - standards quoting

-   be a programming monster

-   don't invest a lot of time in edits.

    They don't give you rep, and they can get reverted and waste your time.

    Some people are over attached to their exact wording even if yours is better.

    And sometimes your just wrong.

-   newb without 15 rep asks question.

    If you answer, find all his questions and upvote them, so that he can upvote your answer.
