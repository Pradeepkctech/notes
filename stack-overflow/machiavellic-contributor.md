-   when you find a duplicate pool answer every question with similar answers. Quote the answer to make it clear that you really answered it.

    If they can me marked as duplicates, do so, or you risk getting your answers deleted.

    Furthermore, closed questions continue netting rep to upvotes, and prevent new answers from coming in.

-   follow on Twitter / RSS someone who comments on the top features of new software releases. E.g. for Git, follow GitHub on Twitter. Then run back to any question which has a new answer.

-   always upvote the question when you answer it:

    - the more upvotes, more likely people are to click it.
    - the OP is more likely to see your answer and feel good and upvote you

-   if a question only has one answer and you come with a better one, upvote the existing answer.

    People will still see your answer anyways, and this will lead to people to upvote you more just to make your better answer surpass the current first. Being second if often an asset.

-   always upvote comments that favor you:

    - I like this answer!
    - also look at that question (when you have answered it)

-   give answers with a mixture of:

    - simple concrete examples
    - standards quoting

-   be a programming monster
