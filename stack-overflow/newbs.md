### Real question in bold as the last thing in the post

The "real question in bold as the last thing in the post and very generic title" syndrome.

> Talk. Talk. Talk. So my question is **WHY blah blah?**.

E.g.: http://stackoverflow.com/revisions/1064499/1

## Unnecessary details

> I was reading a book. Then it made be think. Then something. Then something. Now this is the question: why blah?

E.g. <http://stackoverflow.com/revisions/6893285/1>

Common details:

- what you were doing
- generic things that you've tried: "I've read the manual and googled, it but could not find the answer."

## Missing fundamental details

Version is typical:

> I have this weird internals in software X. (does not give version of X, no and one can reproduce).

## Terminal screenshots instead of text when color does not matter
