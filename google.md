# Google

## Gmail

Multiplying your emails:

- dots are ignored `.`
- `@googlemail.com` is sent to `@gmail.com`

Search operators: <https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7190> They work on filters, and on the search bar.

### Filters

All of the following go directly into the "Has the words" filter input, which does the same as the search box, and takes a single string.

Stupid programming mailing lists that haven't moved to GitHub: hide everything form the list in a label, unless it was sent directly to me:

    list:(<gdb-patches.sourceware.org>) -{to:me OR cc:me}

## tabs converted to spaces

You cannot use gmail to send Git patches in the body:

## Youtube

`youtu.be` is the same as `youtube.com`.

## BigQuery

If your free no account data quota runs out, just create another project!

To export large data sets, you need Google Cloud Storage. Create a bucket named `mybucket`, then export the table. The address is of type: `gs://my_bucket/myfile.gz`. Horrible Google UIs.
