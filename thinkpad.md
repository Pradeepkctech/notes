## FRU

## Field Replacement Unit

Replacement pieces that are sold separately.

List of compatible parts for each model: <https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/documents/tpad-fru-kr>

For older models (e.g. T400), this list seems to be at the end of the hardware maintenance manual.

Online search: <https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/partslookup> Did not work well for a T400.

How to buy them: <https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/documents/ht036683>

Buy them in France: <http://www-304.ibm.com/shop/europe/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/default/CategoryDisplay?categoryId=2643960&storeId=250&catalogId=-250&langId=-2> Then just enter the FRU. I've used a dummy SIRET, and it worked.
