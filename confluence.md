# Confluence

Confluence has an underlying markup but it is only usable directly by admins in a few instances:
<https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Confluence+Wiki+Markup>

## Page URLs

If the page title contains any special characters, the page ID shows instead:
<https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-11285>

If you change the page's title, the old title's URL becomes broken.
Permalink: tools > link to this page > tiny link:
<https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONF34/Linking+to+Confluence+Pages+from+Outside+Confluence>

## Spaces

Space are top level namespaces. "Space" is a fancy name for Wiki. There seem to be space and page level permissions.

It is possible to export entire spaces to HTML:
<https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Exporting+Confluence+Pages+and+Spaces+to+HTML>

User spaces occupy the same namespace as other spaces, usually projects.

## Wiki

Redo: `Ctrl + Y`

Request to make `Ctrl + Shift + Z` do it as well: <https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-30164>
