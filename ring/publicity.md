**[Ring](https://ring.cx)** (e.g. SFLphone is a possibility). Features:

- fully decentralized, [DHT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table)-based (similar to bit-torrent). So no state can control the servers to spy on you, and it is harder for hackers to compromise the entire network
- video, voice, chat
- conferencing, up to as many people as your hardware supports
- Windows, OSX, Linux and Android
- end-to-end encryption
- GPL
- SIP support

Disclaimer: I'm currently paid to work on it.
