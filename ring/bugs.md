# Bugs

I can set the resolution of my external camera to more than 1080p, but that is the nominal. This breaks the image on Android. TODO: check between GNOMEs.

## Sort order of resolution

Current sorts by string order, should be numeric order.

## Android

When accepting a call, the screen may go black, and only come back after tapping it. Annoying.

Once got an undeletable "current call notification". Cannot reproduce easily.
