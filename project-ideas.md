This is a selection of big / hard / interesting projects from my TODO list.

## Data minint

### Stack overflow google rank rep

A Google rank like (engenvalue) rep metric for stack overflow that takes into account tags:

- if someone with high rep on a given tag upvotes you, you get a lot of rep on that tag
- take into account a new property of tags: people can upvote tags if they think a tag fits a question well

This should be implemented as an Stack Overflow http://stackapps.com/ and on GitHub for languages with either GitHub API or http://ghtorrent.org/

## GCC

- GCC code injection on breakpoint conditions *and* action
- GCC as a library-based syntax highlight
- add identifier hyperlink capabilities to GitLab like lxr.free-electrons.com https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/292

## Small

-   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_disk_model in JavaScript

    Possibilities:

    - draw circles around the mouse
    - straight lines that cross two points: http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/TrianglesInThePoincareDisk/ Could also show distance.
    - really slow but great demo: http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wiki/index.php/Poincare_disc_model

    Maybe: https://github.com/cirosantilli/hyperbolic-canvas

-   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_plane in JavaScript

    Show it on a flat circle.
