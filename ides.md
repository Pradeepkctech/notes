# IDEs

## C++

I want an open source cross platform C++ IDE written in C++ with libllvm parsing :-( As of 2017 there are only two options: kdevelop and codelite. :-(

## kdevelop

2017-10, post v5.2 master: breaks down instantly on small project: https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=386720 :-(

Quirky KDE TM compilation method, and requires 50 env vars to launch.

## codelite

wxwidgets... :-)

Clunky. Hard to get started with workspace project set executable.

Ctrl + Click does not jump to definition!

Have to modify makefile to use CC=codlite-cc, maybe reasonable to implement libllvm, but annoying.

Ctrl + Shift + R resources empty...
