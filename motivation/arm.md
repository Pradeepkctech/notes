I've come here after by browsing the who writes Linux publication.

I have a weird desire to learn low level stuff those days. So assembly, compilers and the kernel are at the top of my list.

I've been compulsively cloning the source code for important software like gcc, glibc and the kernel, and grepping them when curiosity overcomes me. Haven't patched them yet, but I'm dying to do it.

Once I got mad because I couldn't understand x86 paging, so learned it I wrote the current No 1 Google search result for "x86 paging tutorial": http://www.cirosantilli.com/x86-paging/

I haven't touched ARM so far, but I'd love to try a new arch. Specially one that dominates mobile and thus the future...

Last week I was amused to learn that register assignment is isomorphic to graph coloring, so gcc approximates an NP-complete problem per compile.

Next time I get tired from sending CVs, I think will `hd` an ELF file and understand every byte. Or if you tell me: hey, learn such and such for the interview, I might stop sending CVs and starting learning those subjects instead.
