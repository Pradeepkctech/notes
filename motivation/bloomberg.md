> Please explain in no more than 100 words why you are interested in a career as a Software Developer?

Software unleashes ultimate informational power.

With it, we can create virtual machines that:

- replicate infinitely
- never get tired
- follow well determined basic rules
- can do GHz of serial operations
- send data across continents in times smaller than human perception

at a cost that most people can afford.

Using those superpowers, we can improve the life of humans by:

- automating repetitive decisions
- allowing them to better absorb and produce new information

Add that to my irrational passion for dissecting and building those little machines, and the question becomes: why wouldn't I be interested?
