# What I want to do

## Technological goals

The ultimate goal of my work is to do full AI to replace all of human work,
both physical and intellectual, by machines.

I don't believe I will see full AI in my lifetime, but I do believe that
I will see the creation of techniques needed to reach full AI, and that
those intermediate steps will have important applications in themselves.

This is already the case for several techniques used on a daily basis, such as OCR,
medical imaging, expert systems and so on.

Also, with the increase in our computational power, it is only a matter of time
until we have a computer that has the same computational capacity as the human brain.
When we do have this much computational power, all we need is to be smart enough to create the right algorithms.
And I do believe it is possible that we will reach this level of computational power in my lifetime.

## Type of work I want to do

I want to become a researcher and an university teacher in applied mathematics.

I have a passion for teaching interested people interesting and useful things.

Also, I love the thrill of discovering and teaching new things,
and understanding new things that are created.

# How the MVA will help me achieve what I want

## Giving me the right technical tools

Computer vision and machine learning (together with movement control)
are in my opinion the keys to reaching full AI, and this is exactly the focus of the MVA course.
For instance, the following courses are certainly useful to reach my technological goals:

- Vision 3D et artificielle
- Machine Learning for Computer Vision I (cours en anglais)
- Reconnaissance d'objet et vision artificielle

Also, the quality of teaching at ENS is very high.

I believe in those facts because I have heard them from many teachers and other students.

Also, I have talked to M. Nicolas Vayatis, one of the course's coordinators,
and a Brazilian colleague who took the course last year (Rafael Rezende)
and they have both confirmed me that the course quality is high, and adequate to reach my goals.

## Allowing me to learn Applied mathematics

Applied mathematics is fun, and MVA will allow me to learn it.

## Giving me the ENS fame

ENS is a renowned school, and taking part in it will certainly be a very positive point
for my future applications in other top institutes.

# Why I am a good investment for ENS

I believe I will be able to do good work and continue making you institution famous.

## I have a wide basis in applied mathematics

I have taken related courses such as:

- Operations research
- Constraint programming
- Signal treatment
- Statistical learning

in top institutes such as my home universty (University of Sao Paulo) and at Ã‰cole Polytechnique.

## I have the necessary computer and language skills

I speak English (Certificate of Proficiency in English CPE in 2004)
and French (TCF C2 in 2011) fluently.

I have experience with several programming languages and tools relevant
to scientific computing including:

- c
- c++
- python
- vim
- git version control
- linux

I also some experience with web design.

## I am passionate about colaborative elearning

I would very much like to contribute to improving textbooks
should teachers allow me to make suggestions.

I will also make suggestions on how teacher can be more productive
using the computer as a teaching tool, which I believe can be a
very efficient way to teach.

I am also very happy when I can help teach my colleagues if they need help.
Everyone has potential to getting an A grade if teaching is good enough.
