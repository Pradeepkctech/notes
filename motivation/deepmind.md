Had heard about you several times, but this is what made me apply: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he8_V0BvbWg>

This is what I was coding the other day: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5k2u25eI8>

In short: I believe that to have full AI, we first need to have interesting real-world like problems to solve.

Recognizing digits with 99.999% precision will never never give full AI.

But solving games where agents eat, fight and learn to survive will.

I've been gathering related ideas at: <https://github.com/cirosantilli/gpu-robot-vision-simulation-full-ai>

The reason I haven't gone further is that I didn't see how to make money with that, and without money I can't work full time on something as I'd like.

But heck, if you're paying people to do it, I'm in, even if there's no immediate profit to be made.

Besides those tile based games, I'd also love to do something continuous with rigid body mechanics as well, e.g. with Box2D / Gazebo / Bullet (and GPU acceleration?!)

## TPU

Finally, I'm very interested in hardware acceleration.

Moore's law is dying, so if we want full AI, we need to think about that.

That is why I came to ARM to work on the Mali GPU, as GPUs are one of the most promising hardware for the future (that has an open API, unlike your TPU :-))

I like ARM, people are awesome, and I'm putting mad hours in to try and get some GPU insight, but the reasons I'm applying are:

- ARM has little focus on GPU compute, since the mobile market is mostly graphics. And I basically don't care how many triangles per second Angry Birds, I only care about AI.
- I spend most of my days fighting with an antiquated testing system instead of getting GPU insight
- you likely pay better, and still do something I consider worth my time (no, I'm not applying for high frequency trading jobs)
