- a per tag page-rank algorithm that ranks the best posts and users per tag
- use post date in metrics (new post with 10 upvotes is better than old post with 10 upvotees)
- duplicate subject resolution

Master in applied maths. A few years professional SW dev experience. Did one year full time sabbhatical e-learning website project: https://github.com/booktree/booktree but later found out the idea was bad, and came up with the 2.0. Proficient in Python, and familiar with web technologies. Currently on semiconductor industry, but haven't forgotten the dream. https://github.com/cirosantilli https://www.linkedin.com/in/cirosantilli/
I am interested in participating in the Innovation Sprint becauseâ€¦ *
In no more than 100 words, please tell us briefly what you hope to gain from participating in the event.

I want to meet other people who are thinking about similar project ideas, and see if we can solve those problems together. In particular, algorithmic ideas I described previously. Because creating free technical information is the optimal action to make the world richer and happier.
Tell us about something you have created that you are proud of: *
In no more than 100 words (not including URLs), please share the story of an idea you have prototyped or brought to fruition before, what you contributed and learned, and why you are proud of this. The idea does not need to relate to the scope of this event but we are particularly interested in contributions to any open (source or access) projects!

The predecessor of my current project: https://github.com/booktree/booktree Led me to become top GitLab contributor for 2015, and learn web. Also led me to see that my idea 1.0 was crap, and start a more refined idea 2.0. Also I'm a Stack Overflow ninja: https://stackoverflow.com/users/895245
Have you been or are you currently involved with eLife?
Please list any associations with us here, such as being an eLife Ambassador or ECAG member, involved in a project or initiative supported by eLife, or having worked directly with us before.

No, never heard of you, got a flier on makerspace.

Hide Openness and transparency
We expect Sprint participants to work openly and make resulting outputs openly available immediately or as soon as is feasible, using open source licenses for code and software and permissive licenses (CC-BY or CC-0) for other content.
If selected, do you agree to meet this expectation as a participant? *


Hide Diversity
We value diversity in the communities we engage with. We are asking these questions because they will allow us to proactively select under-represented groups should we need to choose between highly rated applications. We may use aggregate data to assess the diversity and inclusion of our event, and publish the final results, but all individual information will be kept private. If you prefer not to say, please respond with that or leave the field blank.

This information is being collected at this stage for planning purposes only.
