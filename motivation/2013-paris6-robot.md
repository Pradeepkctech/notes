# What I want to do

## Technological goals

The ultimate goal of my work is to make robots that can do everything that a human can
to substitute all of physical and intellectual work by machines.

This means that we will need both the mechanical techniques to make a robot that has
similar capabilities to the human body, and algorithmic techniques so that the
robot can think like a human being.

I don't believe I will see this happen in my lifetime, but I do believe that
I will see the creation of techniques needed to reach that goal, and that
those intermediate steps will have important applications in themselves.

This is already the case for several techniques used on a daily basis,
such as the widespread use of robots in the manufacturing industry.

## Type of work I want to do in the future

I want to become a researcher and an university teacher in applied mathematics.

I have a passion for teaching interested people interesting and useful things.

Also, I love the thrill of discovering and teaching new things,
and understanding new things that are created.

# How the SAR will help me achieve what I want

## Giving me the right technical tools

I believe that the tools taught at the SAR match the technological needs
needed to reach my objectives. I am mostly interested in the parcours
"Sysèmes intelligents en robotique" and in the following courses in particular:

- Vision par ordinatuer
- Introduction à la reconnaissance des formes
- Dynamique des systèmes

I have already visited M. Ben Amar Faiz, course coordinator, at the SAR laboratory to discuss
if he believed course would suit my goals and capabilities and my visit
only confirmed my positive expectations for the course.

I am also attracted by the high quality of the Paris 6 University,
which I have heard from several teachers and other students.

## Allowing me to learn Applied mathematics

Applied mathematics is fun, and SAR will allow me to learn it more.

# Why I am a good investment for Paris 6

I believe I will be able to do good work and continue making your institution famous.

## I have a wide basis in applied mathematics

I have taken related courses such as:

- Operations research
- Constraint programming
- Basic control theory
- Signal treatment

in top institutes such as my home university (University of Sao Paulo, Brazil)
and at École Polytechnique, where I have done a two years double degree program.

## I have the necessary computer and language skills

I speak English (Certificate of Proficiency in English CPE in 2004)
and French (TCF C2 in 2011) fluently.

Also I have experience with several programming languages and tools relevant
to scientific computing including: c, c++, python, vim, git and linux
as you may check at my github: <https://github.com/cirosantilli>

## I am passionate about collaborative elearning

I would very much like to contribute to improving textbooks
should teachers allow me to make suggestions.

I am also very happy when I can help teach my colleagues if they need help.
I believe that everyone has potential to getting an A grade if teaching is good enough.
