Service Engineer

North or South America

GitLab B.V. is growing quickly and we would love to grow our team with a Service Engineer. The rising popularity of GitLab means that our professional services are in high demand. If you got the skills to help to our clients we would love to talk to you.

Because most of our clients are in the United States you will need to be in a timezone near there. We are open to candidates who are located from Pacific Standard Time (-8) to Atlantic Standard Time (-4). If you are a vampire you can be located from Moscow Standard Time (+4) to Singapore Time (+8). We're open to candidates from both inside and outside the United States.
Responsibilities:

You would be engaging with our customers, this can be anything from as small advertising firm, a university to Fortune 100 clients. This will be mostly via email, but you will also have video conferences with them when needed.

You will also help our Community Manager with questions coming from Twitter and Facebook and respond to questions on the GitLab.com Support Forum. When you do not have an appointment you engage with the rest of the core team to improve GitLab. You fix problems, add features, improve documentation, polish the website and engage with people on various forums.
Requirements

    B.Sc. in Computer Science or equivalent experience
    Above average knowledge of Unix and Unix based Operating Systems
    1+ years of programming experience (Ruby and Ruby on Rails preferred)
    Good people skills
    Excellent spoken and written English

At GitLab B.V. we mostly work from home and love to go to Rails conferences (paid for by GitLab B.V.). We are looking for people who can handle and enjoy the freedom that comes with working from home. Our water coolers are Slack and a daily Hangout.
Day in the life

A typical day as service engineer for GitLab starts with the weekly morning meeting. As you have a lot of contact with our customers, it's your task during the meeting to call everyone else to duty. After the meeting, you provide support to large companies using GitLab. Rather than answering everything quickly, you'll spend most of your time fixing bugs in GitLab, helping customers with complex scaling problems and if you can't solve it yourself, working with your colleagues on the issue at hand.

Occasionally, you'll get access into the system of our customers to solve problems on the spot or call with them to discuss their plans of using GitLab.

Besides support, you'll be looking for ways to improve GitLab in any facet. You might want to build a new feature, improve the website (yes please!) or initiate something new. You'll also be asked to manage our GitLab.com instance, where thousands of users push and pull happily every day, and have to help with releasing GitLab every month on the 22nds.

GitLab is a booming startup in every sense of the word. You can do anything and there is more to do than hands are available. Everything you do will be something someone else doesn't have the time for or didn't have the time to think about. You'll make a significant change in the company.

## Submission

I am contributor #10 by commits and #6 by additions according to https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/graphs/contributors 

My "true" CV is: http://www.cirosantilli.com/

I've worked 2014 basically full time on GitLab because I was planning a fork: https://github.com/booktree/booktree but I gave up because I found it too risky.

I've worked on multiple aspects of GitLab, in particular:

- full stack database to UI new features, e.g. added "Star" feature: https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/pull/7233
- testing infrastructure, e.g.: https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/pull/7903
- documentation: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cookbook-gitlab/merge_requests/29
- refactoring: https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/pull/7912

Visit http://www.cirosantilli.com/projects/#merged-by-others hold shift and then sort by "Project" then "Size" to see the full list.

I've been paying attention to web security, see: https://github.com/cirosantilli/test

I've made countless proposals and comments on the forums:

- https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=involves%3Acirosantilli
- http://feedback.gitlab.com/users/42957132-ciro-santilli and many under puppet accounts before I found out that I could put zero votes on an issue...
- https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues I have been made a collaborator there

Also check my stack overflow contributions on the relevant tags: http://stackoverflow.com/users/895245?tab=tags , e.g. git, gitlab, rails, html.

Conclusion: I like helping people with issues :-)

I am not a deployment master, but I've successfully deployed once to AWS (now offline), and I want to learn more about it, CI and containers.

I've checked the job board again after seeing the openness tweet: https://twitter.com/gitlab/status/628186917830569984 I love that.

I think GitLab is really useful and I love open source. When I see those GNU projects using mailing lists it gives me the creeps.

I live in Paris now. About the timezone, there are a few possibilities:

- I can move immediately to a city next to Sao Paulo, Brazil (Santos https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santos,_S%C3%A3o_Paulo ), where my parents live, at timezone -3 and work 15 - 22
- I can stay here at timezone and work 16 - 24, offset by 2 hours from your ideal time. I already work until midnight daily.

My girlfriend is in Paris, but I could stay in Brazil for some time. We would like to go to the USA in the future.
