## Why I am applying

For some reason I have put it into my head that compilers and assembly are super cool and useful.

This is likely linked to the fact that I like to understand things "profoundly".

I am not satisfied until I have understood underlying technologies.

And what could be more profound for software than those topics?

I have found about you through HiPEAC, which I found while browsing the GCC wiki.

I also like the idea that one small efficiency improvement we make can have an impact on thousands of upstream projects.

## Why I might be useful to you

### Must have skills

-   Working knowledge of C and C++:

    I'm starting to understand C reasonably well:

    - [Cheatsheet](https://github.com/cirosantilli/cpp-cheat/blob/2ab323c701a95b1d524deb4f763a4ba8bc6fa54c/c.c)
    - I can often find ANSI C standard quotes when in doubt
    - read some code for a few projects: GCC, kernel, Git. [Example](http://stackoverflow.com/a/30308151/895245).
    - I am studying what GCC compiles to in x86, see: <https://github.com/cirosantilli/assembly-cheat/tree/172f22ca8527b161401d15d0ab93ed8a20209cf5/compiler-generated>

    I'm not a C++ master, but I know some basics. What I've studied so far: <https://github.com/cirosantilli/cpp-cheat/blob/2ab323c701a95b1d524deb4f763a4ba8bc6fa54c/cpp.cpp>

-   Working knowledge of debuggers

    I know the basics of GDB. [Cheatsheet](https://github.com/cirosantilli/cpp-cheat/blob/7208ce6b9d32fcb0c53e7997df035ece3bb5ff95/gdb/README.md).

-   Linux or Windows operating environments.

    I am familiar with Linux: <https://github.com/cirosantilli/linux-cheat>

-   Self motivated, and willingness to learn new technologies on the job.

    Yes!

-   Excellent communication skills, both verbal and written.

    I'll let you be the judge of that :-)

If you think that my knowledge is not enough on those areas, just tell me what to learn, how much time I have, and I will learn it.

### Candidate skills

Those that I know about:

-   Build systems and compiler tool-chains.  Understanding of the different stages within a compiler.

    I know GNU make, and I am [studying GCC](https://github.com/cirosantilli/cpp-cheat/tree/7208ce6b9d32fcb0c53e7997df035ece3bb5ff95/gcc).

    [My explanation of linking basics on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/30507725/895245).

-   Understanding of assembly languages and object file formats.

    I know x86 and ELF.

    I am the number 1 result for the Google search: "x86 paging tutorial": <http://www.cirosantilli.com/x86-paging/>

    [What I know about IA-32](https://github.com/cirosantilli/assembly-cheat/blob/172f22ca8527b161401d15d0ab93ed8a20209cf5/ia-32/main.asm).

    [My dissection of an ELF NASM hello world](https://github.com/cirosantilli/assembly-cheat/blob/172f22ca8527b161401d15d0ab93ed8a20209cf5/elf-hello-world.md).

I look forward to learning CMake, LLVM and GPUs.

### Qualifications

I have diplomas from:

- Ecole Polytechnique in applied mathematics. Top Times ranking 2013 French engineering university.
- University of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil in in automation and control. Top Times ranking 2013 South America university.

I have taken computer science courses in those degrees, but a lot of what I know I taught myself online.

Quite honestly, I don't have major projects in the compilation domain yet, except for my tutorials and Stack Overflow contributions.

My largest software contribution so far was to GitLab: I was [the number 2 contributor from 2013 to 2015](https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/graphs/contributors?from=2013-01-01&to=2015-01-01&type=a).

I worked on it for an educational cause: the [Booktree project](https://github.com/booktree/booktree), but web development is not my favorite technology, and I got back into lower level things.
