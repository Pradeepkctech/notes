    We're Hiring
    Compiler Engineers Wanted
    If you're a talented software engineer who is passionate about open
    source, embedded systems and compilers, we'd love to hear from you!
    Embecosm   is   recruiting   software   engineers   to   join   our   team,   which   provides
    services   developing   free   and   open   source   (F/OSS)   compilers   for   companies
    around the world. Our specialities are embedded processors and compilers for
    silicon chip modeling. Examples of the compilers on which we work include GCC
    for the Atmel AVR, Synopsys ARC and Adapteva Epiphany processors, LLVM for
    OpenRISC, and Verilator modeling of AVR processors for Atmel.
    You will join Embecosm's small team of world-renowned experts, and work on
    either the  the GNU  compiler tool  chain, LLVM  or the  Verilator  Verilog to C++
    compiler. Your mentors will be J
    ö rn Rennecke (GNU compiler), Simon Cook (LLVM)
    and Dr Jeremy Bennett (Verilator).
    While prior experience  is welcome, it is not a priority for us. This is a deeply
    specialist field, and we  recognize  that you  will  almost  certainly need training.
    Although it is highly likely you will have at least a degree, it isn't essential.
    What   you   must   be   is   provably   an   outstanding   programmer   (language   doesn't
    matter) with a commitment to free and open source software. You'll need to have
    some   evidence   of   your   potential   in   compilers   —   it   could   be   from   something
    you've done in your spare time, as part of a student project, or even that you did
    really well in a compiler course. You also must be eligible to work in the UK.
    Starting salary is £40k-£60k + profit sharing bonus. We allocate 10% of your time
    to work on your own projects, we are very active within the F/OSS community
    and you will contribute publicly to the F/OSS projects on which you work. With our
    global customer base, there will be some international travel.
    Initially you will be expected to work in our Lymington HQ for at least a couple of
    years, for which we'll pay relocation. However once you have experience (or if
    you already have it), you will be able to work from home if you so choose.
    Embecosm   is   an   equal   opportunities   employer   and   we   encourage   applicants
    irrespective   of   age,   disability,   gender,   race,   marital   status,   religion   or   sexual
    orientation.

Hello,

I have found you after Andrew Burgess replied to a simple message on the GDB ML. He had already implemented the feature I wanted, and that was so awesome I decided to check where he worked, and found the opening :-)

## Background

I have graduated from some of the best engineering schools in Brazil and France: Ecole Polytechnique and University of Sao Paulo in applied mathematics, with a Masters Degree from Ecole Polytechnique.

I took a few computer science courses in college (including the mandatory make an interpreter project), but a large part of what I've learnt about computers was through books and passion projects.

I've graduated in 2014, and worked 4 months in a Fintech enterprise in Paris, but ended up leaving because it was too much finance, and too little technique.

Since then, I've been studying things that I love, which is basically "low-level" stuff, since I'm the kind of person who gets a kick out of knowing how my computer works in detail.

I am currently very excited about compilers and looking for a job in the domain. I have been studying GCC and related topics for the last month: ELF format, x86, etc.

I currently live in Paris, but would love to move to the UK. I have the Italian Citizenship (5th generation descendant, I grew up in Brazil).

My CV is annexed, and also have a look at my website: http://www.cirosantilli.com/

## Potential

I don't have patches (yet!) to the project, but a few things to convince you that I have potential:

- I hold the number 1 google result for "x86 paging tutorial": http://www.cirosantilli.com/x86-paging/
- Relocation 101 tutorial: http://stackoverflow.com/a/30507725/895245
- Overview of the GCC options systems and -O3 in particular: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1778538/how-many-gcc-optimization-levels-are-there
- Study of what GCC compiles to in x86: https://github.com/cirosantilli/assembly-cheat/tree/172f22ca8527b161401d15d0ab93ed8a20209cf5/compiler-generated
- What I know about IA-32: https://github.com/cirosantilli/assembly-cheat/blob/172f22ca8527b161401d15d0ab93ed8a20209cf5/ia-32/main.asm
- Dissection of an ELF hello world: https://github.com/cirosantilli/assembly-cheat/blob/172f22ca8527b161401d15d0ab93ed8a20209cf5/elf-hello-world.md
- related higher level stuff that I know:
    - C: https://github.com/cirosantilli/cpp-cheat/tree/d9f60f827ffdecc06a2390020a3d1179fd49c06a/c
    - Linux: https://github.com/cirosantilli/linux-cheat

My largest software contribution so far was to GitLab (open source): I was [the number 2 contributor from 2013 to 2015](https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/graphs/contributors?from=2013-01-01&to=2015-01-01&type=a). I worked on it for an educational cause: the Booktree project https://github.com/booktree/booktree , but web development is not my favorite technology, and I got back into lower level things.

Besides GCC, I would also love to learn about LLVM some day.

One of my strengths is the ability to explain things to others, see my articles: http://www.cirosantilli.com/articles/ My technique is to quickly switch between theory (standards, rationale, internals) and practice (examples, tool usage) to link them.

I would _love_ to work with open source projects as a job. Open source just makes the world richer.

## Proposal

If you like, you could give me a small (1 week?) project(s) on one of the open source projects to which you contribute for me to do under your supervision for you to evaluate me and see how we get along.

We could have a quick daily Skype meeting for me to report my progress + async communication if I get stuck on some point.

All best,

Ciro SANTILLI
