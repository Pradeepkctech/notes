I want to understand what you are doing in the area robotics. I live nearby, would like to discuss it over coffee / lunch with someone that works on the area. If convinced, I might apply for a job at some point. Also I work at ARM, I would like to see if there can be any link between ARM's ML effort and what you are doing. My cell: 07719546386, email: ciro.santilli@gmail.com I'm free any day of March except from 20th - 27th Cheers.
