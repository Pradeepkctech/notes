I cannot put generic points more clearly than my cover letter website:

Why this job in particular? Because it contains the words "Software development, Networking and hardware, security", and that excites me. Ah, and "Graduate Programme" since I'm still relatively newb (2014 grad).

And I want to go to an English speaking country. Enough croissants for me.

I've once submitted a GitLab security issue to ZDI. That was cool. But I then made an update to the issue by email without PGP encryption and it got disqualified. Ouch. Lesson learned.
