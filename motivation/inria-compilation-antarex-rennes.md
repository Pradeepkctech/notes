# INRIA compilation ANTAREX Rennes

Bonjour Erven,

I was preparing to answer an ELF question on SO, when I saw this job
post, and switched to a gmail tab right away:
http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/100882/ing%C3%A9nieur-r-d-en-compilation-h-f-cdd-3-ans-inria

I don't have the infinite years of experience required for this job,
so likely I can't do it (?? :-)), but I'm totally excited about this
kind of stuff, and if you have any similar opportunities in the area
of HPC + GPUs + compilers, including PHDs, this is an application.
Same for you colleagues that are doing similar things.

I'm an M2 in Applied Maths from Ecole Polytechnique, graduated in
2014, did some things after that. CV-website:

For the last 6 months I've been teaching myself "low-level stuff" from
the compiler downwards... because I find it super cool and want to
work with it. Ah, and answering a ton of hard old useful Stack
Overflow questions which will give me hardly any rep just to improve
the world:

Those are hidden behind old HTML answer tags that get tons of rep, but
I don't care about those anymore :-)

My latest project is:
https://github.com/cirosantilli/x86-bare-metal-examples/ where I'm
learning / teaching x86 OS programming. The long term goal is to be
able to implement device drivers that play well with the kernel, and
and in particular GPU drivers.

I'm equally passionate about the compilation toolchain. Right now I
understand GCC Linux the externals reasonably (what unoptimized C
compiles to, ELF, x86, linking process). Optimization is the thing I
want to learn next now that I'm kind of happy with externals.

Je parle français, et je suis à Paris maintenant. English is faster
though. Less accents.
