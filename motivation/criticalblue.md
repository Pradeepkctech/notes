## GRADUATE SOFTWARE PERFORMANCE ENGINEER

Hi,

I've found you through https://www.hipeac.net/members/

I really want to work with the Linux kernel + compilers + performance because I find those things super cool.

I'm a graduate from Ecole Polytechnique, France in Applied mathematics, considered one of the best in France. CV website: http://www.cirosantilli.com/

Haven't touched Android yet, but I can (and want to) learn.
