# What I want to do

## Technological goals

The ultimate goal of my work is to do full AI to replace all of human work,
both physical and intellectual, by machines.

I don't believe I will see full AI in my lifetime, but I do believe that
I will see the creation of techniques needed to reach full AI, and that
those intermediate steps will have important applications in themselves.

This is already the case for several techniques used on a daily basis, such as OCR,
medical imaging, expert systems and so on.

## Type of work I want to do in the future

I want to become a researcher and an university teacher in applied mathematics
or computer science.

I have a passion for teaching interested people interesting and useful things.

Also, I love the thrill of discovering and teaching new things,
and understanding new things that are created.

# How the IAD will help me achieve what I want

## Giving me the right technical tools

I believe that the tools taught at the IAD match the technological needs
needed to reach my objectives. I am mostly interested in the parcours
"Agents Intelligents, Apprentissage et Décision" (AIAD) and in the following courses in particular:

- Apprentissage automatique, apprentissage statistiqueVision par ordinatuer
- Apprentissage symbolique, découverte et créativité
- Introduction aux Agents Cognitifs et Autonomes

I am also attracted by the high teaching quality of the Paris 6 University,
which I have heard from several teachers and other students.

## Allowing me to learn Applied mathematics and Compute science

Applied mathematics and computer science are fun,
and IAD will allow me to learn it more.

# Why I am a good investment for Paris 6

I believe I will be able to do good work and continue making your institution famous.

## I have a wide basis in applied mathematics

I have taken related courses such as:

- Operations research
- Constraint programming
- Signal treatment
- Statistical learning

in top institutes such as my home university (University of Sao Paulo, Brazil)
and at École Polytechnique, where I have done a two years double degree program.

## I have the necessary computer and language skills

I speak English (Certificate of Proficiency in English CPE in 2004)
and French (TCF C2 in 2011) fluently.

Also I have experience with several programming languages and tools relevant
to scientific computing including: c, c++, python, vim, git and linux
as you may check at my github: https://github.com/cirosantilli

## I am passionate about collaborative elearning

I would very much like to contribute to improving textbooks
should teachers allow me to make suggestions.

I am also very happy when I can help teach my colleagues if they need help.
I believe that everyone has potential to getting an A grade if teaching is good enough.
