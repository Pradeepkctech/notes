> Please write a few paragraphs telling us about the architecture and tradeoffs of a large system you built, your experience building systems and tools for highly technical users, and your interest in ML/AI in particular.

Haven't built or extensively maintained big system yet. But I have used tons of different software tech, and quickly learn whatever is needed to get the job done, and I have quickly integrated diverse techs into my quick projects: 

Tools for highly technical users: basically what I'm doing now at ARM, we make debug tools for GPUs. Advantage: less eye candy, more substance. Disadvantage: "hey, there are only 50 people who are going to use this, so let's get it done quick even if somewhat sloppy".

## Interest in ML/AI

Would be a huge step towards my ultimate non-transhumanistic goal: Unconditional basic income, by doing the work that millions of humans must do today but cheaper. 

And we might actually live it if computing power continues to increase.

That is why I came to ARM: to learn GPUs, which are the most promising current computing power increase tech. 

But I still keep an eye for applications of that computing power, and I think that a general game playing agent is THE way to go (specially on games designed to be played by computers like Gym).

Made this baby step just before I found you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5k2u25eI8

Gathering research at: https://github.com/cirosantilli/gpu-robot-vision-simulation-full-ai before that

I'm specially interested in making a single game to which (infinitely) new mechanics are progressively added:

- game designed for computers to play, does not require any previous real world knowledge
- has some analogy with real world, e.g. animals eating food and each other
- multi agent stuff

Either rogue-like, or DOOM like (but in particular a 1D-only horizontal visual line cut of DOOM).

Or just go nuts and do 3D rigid body dynamics through Gazebo (like Darpa challenges have already done, but those problems require human pre-knowledge). Your RaaS thing is likely to duplicate them? Specially http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?cat=connect_ros
