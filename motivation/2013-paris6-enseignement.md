# What I want to do

## Technical goals goals

I want to improve the current education system:

- give students more choice of what they will learn
- reduce the costs of education, and if possible make if free for students
- make everyone learn better and enjoy learning

and I firmly believe that the way to do this is through education technology
which only now is beginning to be explored, in particular collaborative
methods based on merit metrics.

## Type of work I want to do in the future

I want to become either researcher and an university teacher in computer science
or work in enterprises which improve elearning and information organization/retrieval
such as Google.

I have a passion for teaching interested people interesting and useful things.

I love the thrill of facing technological challenges
imposed by complex design decisions.

# How the IFL will help me achieve what I want

## Giving me the right technical tools

I believe that the tools taught at the IFL match the technological needs
needed to reach my objectives.

- Approches cognitives et travail collaboratif IFL
- Interface et Interaction Humains-Machines et Ingénierie Web

I am also attracted by the high teaching quality of the Paris 6 University,
which I have heard from several teachers and other students.

## Allowing me to learn Compute science

Computer science is fun, and IFL will allow me to learn it more.

# Why I am a good investment for Paris 6

I believe I will be able to do good work and continue making your institution famous.

## I have a wide basis in applied mathematics and computer science

I have taken related courses such as:

- Operations research
- Constraint programming
- Statistical learning

in top institutes such as my home university (University of Sao Paulo, Brazil)
and at École Polytechnique, where I have done a two years double degree program.

## I have the necessary computer and language skills

I speak English (Certificate of Proficiency in English CPE in 2004)
and French (TCF C2 in 2011) fluently.

Also I have experience with several programming languages and tools relevant
to elearning including: c, c++, python, vim, git and linux
as you may check at my github: https://github.com/cirosantilli

I also have some experience with web design in django and databases.

## I am passionate about collaborative elearning

I would very much like to contribute to improving textbooks
should teachers allow me to make suggestions.

I am also very happy when I can help teach my colleagues if they need help.
I believe that everyone has potential to getting an A grade if teaching is good enough.
