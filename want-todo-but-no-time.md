Stuff which I'd like to do on important side projects but no time. In decreasing importance:

-   Merge <https://github.com/tpope/vim-markdown> (better syntax hilight in general, used by Vim default distro)
    and <https://github.com/plasticboy/vim-markdown> (more features)

-   <https://github.com/karlcow/markdown-testsuite>: put tests on left of outputs table, not engines:

        Engine 1: kramdown
        Engine 2: multimarkdown
        Engine 3: redcarpet

                     123
        test name 1 |F F|
        test name 2 |FF |

-   Markdown lint tool: <http://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/questions/7138/markdown-lint-tool>
