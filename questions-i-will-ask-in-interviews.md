# Questions I will ask in interviews

First give a book that covers all questions, and say about what you are going to ask.

Ask a lot of small questions. Deepen them as the candidate shows knowledge on a domain.

What matters is how deep he understands at least one of those domains: if he can do so, he can also do it for other domains as needed.

## C

-   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5481579/whats-the-difference-between-function-prototype-and-declaration

    Why:

        int fuc();

        int fuc(float f) {
        printf("%f", f);
        return 0;
        }

    does not compile?

## Java

- string pool and Integer pool
- constructors: the first line is magical, cannot self call...
- What is serializableUUID?
- internals
    - bytecode
    - memory
