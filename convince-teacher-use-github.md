Hi, my name is Ciro Santilli, I studied at Ecole Polytechnique, live in Paris, homepage: http://www.cirosantilli.com/

Now I want to convince all teachers in the world to put up all their teaching material on GitHub so that:

- everyone can reuse and improve it
- students can learn by improving their own learning material

DISCLAIMER: why I want to do that:

- because it's the optimal action to improve the world
- I will try to get money out of it somehow so I can continue doing this optimal action (becomes a 
GitHub employee, an educational consultant, or develop and sell related software)

Are you currently teachers at UPMC?

I would love to meet you face to face in your office or public place like a caffe, possibly over the weekend, to discuss these ideas if you are interested.

The initial focus will be computer science since since those teachers are more likely to adopt the idea, and then spread from there.

I speak French, but am writing in English because it's faster and more reusable. I don't mind working with French courses.
